Whether it’s a programming language, database, or web framework, it’s such an amazing feat. I’m five years into my career and I personally wouldn’t know where to start with any of these. I wish there was a clear roadmap that outlined &amp;ldquo;do this and you’ll be good enough to build something like Redis.&amp;rdquo; I think the roadmap is to just keep coding?</description></item><item><title>Learning Go</title><link>https://www.steve.codes/posts/2022-08-28-learning-go/</link><pubDate>Sun, 28 Aug 2022 22:18:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.steve.codes/posts/2022-08-28-learning-go/</guid><description>This post was supposed to be about building a barebones Redis prototype in Go. I’ve never written Go before, so I’m not sure why I thought diving head first into a complex project like this would be a good idea. I was making gradual progress, but the constant pausing to look up syntax was getting tiring. I decided to put the project on hold and take the time to learn Go a bit more methodically.</description></item><item><title>Blog Stack Part 1: Hugo and GitHub Pages</title><link>https://www.steve.codes/posts/2022-08-17-blog-stack-p1-hugo-and-github-pages/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Aug 2022 00:17:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.steve.codes/posts/2022-08-17-blog-stack-p1-hugo-and-github-pages/</guid><description>Decisions, Decisions When I went to create this blog, I quickly hit decision paralysis. Should I use a CMS? Which one? Strapi? Ghost? Sanity? Should I write the frontend in Next.js, or keep it simple with a static site generator like Hugo or Jekyll? Is WordPress still a thing? Where should I host?
After hours of research, I finally decided on Next.js and Strapi. Over-engineered for the purpose of this blog, but I thought learning this stack would be interesting.</description></item></channel></rss>
