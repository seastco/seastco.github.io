This post was supposed to be about building a barebones Redis prototype in Go. I’ve never written Go before, so I’m not sure why I thought diving head first into building a Redis prototype would be a good idea. The constant pausing to look up syntax was getting annoying, so I decided to hit pause and approach learning Go a bit more methodically.

I’m most proficient in Java. It was widely used at my university, and it’s the only language I’ve ever written professionally. I know enough Python to get stuff done, but I wouldn’t call myself proficient. Anything outside of that I haven’t touched in 5+ years.

I began going through [A Tour of Go](https://go.dev/tour/list), but it felt too bland. I like gamified tutorials with badges, streaks, and progress bars. Keeps me motiviated and gives me a better sense of achievement. Remembering my early programming days, I checked to see if [codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com) was still a thing. Not only is it still a thing, but it is seemingly more popular than ever. The course catalog has grown to have pretty much anything you could ask for. I jumped into the two Go courses and was able to finish in a weekend.

Overall, I’m loving Go. I’m still a noob so I don’t have a novel take to share, but I just love all the little things they get right. Goroutines, defer, failing to compile for unused imports and variables, support for multiple return types, type inference. All great features. Side note: is there a mainstream language that is not enjoyable to learn? TypeScript, Elixir, Rust, Kotlin, Julia, Swift, etc. are all so refined these days. I’m sure they’re all great; I’ve never been one to partake in language wars.

With codecademy checked off, back to the Redis prototype I go (pun intended).
